## 🎉 **Great News: 98% Success!**
Your deployment is almost perfect! All major components are working:
- ✅ Storage account with all directories created
- ✅ Web app and app service plan deployed
- ✅ Azure AD applications cleaned up
- ✅ Key Vault access policies updated

## ⚠️ **Only Issue: Key Vault Firewall**
Terraform Cloud IP `18.207.100.119` is blocked by Key Vault firewall.

## 🔧 **Choose Your Fix (Pick ONE):**

### Option A: Quick Script Fix (30 seconds)
```bash
cd environments/prod
./fix-keyvault-firewall.sh
# Choose option 1 when prompted
```

### Option B: Manual Azure CLI (1 minute)
```bash
az keyvault network-rule add \
    --name lab-uks-entra-kv \
    --ip-address 18.207.100.119
```

### Option C: Terraform Config Update (2 minutes)
**Already done!** Just commit and push:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Allow Key Vault access for TFC deployment"
git push origin main
```

## ⏱️ **Then Wait & Retry**
1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for changes to propagate
2. **Trigger new Terraform Cloud run**
3. **✅ Deployment will complete successfully!**

## 🔒 **Security Note**
After successful deployment, you can re-enable Key Vault firewall:
```bash
# Re-enable restrictions (optional)
az keyvault update --name lab-uks-entra-kv --default-action Deny
az keyvault network-rule add --name lab-uks-entra-kv --ip-address YOUR_IP
```
